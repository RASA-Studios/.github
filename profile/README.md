# We Are RASA Studios

What started out as a group of friends has evolved over the years to become a professional Minecraft building and video production team. In 2017, we officially became RASA Studios and began to make a name for ourselves with new projects and new ideas. However, we always keep to our roots and at the core, we are a group of friends who just want to have a bit of fun.

We have talented members spread across six countries, each fulfilling their individual roles to form this incredible team. As a group, we have years of experience; from building, to editing, to sound design, to art, to programming. RASA Studios strives to create high-quality content.
